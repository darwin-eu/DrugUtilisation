\usage{
requirePriorDrugWashout(
  cohort,
  days,

  name = omopgenerics::tableName(cohort)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort}{A cohort_table object.}

\item{days}{The number of days required to have passed since the last cohort

record kept).}

\item{cohortId}{A cohort definition id to restrict by. If NULL, all cohorts
will be included.}

\item{name}{Name of the new cohort table, it must be a length 1 character
vector.}

individual.
