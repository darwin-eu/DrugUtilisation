#' Generate a set of drug cohorts based on ATC classification
#'
#' @description
#' Adds a new cohort table to the cdm reference with individuals who have drug
#' exposure records that belong to the specified Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
#' (ATC) classification. Cohort start and end dates will be based on drug record
#' start and end dates, respectively. Records that overlap or have fewer days
#' between them than the specified gap era will be concatenated into a single
#' cohort entry.
#'
#' @param cdm A cdm reference.
#' @param name The name of the new cohort table to add to the cdm reference.
#' @param atcName Names of ATC classification of interest.
#' @param gapEra Number of days between two continuous exposures to be
#' considered in the same era. Records that have fewer days between them than
#' this gap will be concatenated into the same cohort record.
#' @param ... Arguments to be passed to `CodelistGenerator::getATCCodes()`.
#' @param durationRange Deprecated.
#' @param imputeDuration Deprecated.
#' @param priorUseWashout Deprecated
#' @param priorObservation Deprecated.
#' @param cohortDateRange Deprecated.
#' @param limit Deprecated.
#'
#' @return The function returns the cdm reference provided with the addition of
#' the new cohort table.
