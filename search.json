Let’s start creating simple mock data set exposures example: Let’s now create DrugUtilisation cohort numberExposure daysPrescribed arguments TRUE: generated cohort span 1st January 15th February 1 extra column (days_prescribed): Now can instead using provided end date set end date : cohort_start_date + days_prescribed - 1. Note subtract 1 day days_prescribed defined ‘duration’ end - start + 1 (start end date counted number days count). One solution directly cohort_end_date = cohort_start_date + days_prescribed - 1, can lead two main problems: (1) sources handles correctly addition subtraction numbers date, (2) create overlapping cohort records. account issues use CohortConstructor, particular padCohortDate() function, see example: Now can see created cohort wished 1st January 26th February: Please note change data drug_exposure, use cohort see days individual ‘exposed’ days 1st January 15th February count days individual ongoing prescription recorded:","code":"cdm2 <- mockDrugUtilisation(drug_exposure = tibble(   drug_exposure_id = 1:2L,   person_id = 1L,   drug_concept_id = 1125360L,   drug_exposure_start_date = as.Date(c(\"2020-01-01\", \"2020-01-20\")),   drug_exposure_end_date = as.Date(c(\"2020-01-30\", \"2020-02-15\")) ), source = \"duckdb\") cdm2$drug_exposure #> # Source:   table<drug_exposure> [?? x 23] #> # Database: DuckDB 1.4.2 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.5.2/:memory:] #>   drug_exposure_id person_id drug_concept_id drug_exposure_start_date #>              <int>     <int>           <int> <date>                   #> 1                1         1         1125360 2020-01-01               #> 2                2         1         1125360 2020-01-20               #> # ℹ 19 more variables: drug_exposure_end_date <date>, #> #   drug_exposure_start_datetime <date>, drug_exposure_end_datetime <date>, #> #   verbatim_end_date <date>, drug_type_concept_id <int>, stop_reason <chr>, #> #   refills <int>, quantity <dbl>, days_supply <int>, sig <chr>, #> #   route_concept_id <int>, lot_number <chr>, provider_id <int>, #> #   visit_occurrence_id <int>, visit_detail_id <int>, drug_source_value <chr>, #> #   drug_source_concept_id <int>, route_source_value <chr>, … cdm2 <- generateDrugUtilisationCohortSet(   cdm = cdm2,    name = \"dus_cohort\",    conceptSet = codes,    daysPrescribed = TRUE ) #> ℹ Subsetting drug_exposure table #> ℹ Checking whether any record needs to be dropped. #> ℹ Collapsing overlaping records. #> ℹ Collapsing records with gapEra = 1 days. cdm2$dus_cohort |>   glimpse() #> Rows: ?? #> Columns: 5 #> Database: DuckDB 1.4.2 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.5.2/:memory:] #> $ cohort_definition_id <int> 1 #> $ subject_id           <int> 1 #> $ cohort_start_date    <date> 2020-01-01 #> $ cohort_end_date      <date> 2020-02-15 #> $ days_prescribed      <int> 57 library(CohortConstructor) cdm2$dus_cohort <- cdm2$dus_cohort |>   mutate(days_to_add = days_prescribed - 1L) |>   padCohortDate(     days = \"days_to_add\",     cohortDate = \"cohort_end_date\",     indexDate = \"cohort_start_date\",     collapse = TRUE   ) cdm2$dus_cohort #> # Source:   table<dus_cohort> [?? x 4] #> # Database: DuckDB 1.4.2 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.5.2/:memory:] #>   cohort_definition_id subject_id cohort_start_date cohort_end_date #>                  <int>      <int> <date>            <date>          #> 1                    1          1 2020-01-01        2020-02-15 cdm2$dus_cohort |>   addDaysExposed(conceptSet = codes, gapEra = 1L) |>   glimpse() #> Rows: ?? #> Columns: 5 #> Database: DuckDB 1.4.2 [unknown@Linux 6.11.0-1018-azure:R 4.5.2/:memory:] #> $ cohort_definition_id       <int> 1 #> $ subject_id                 <int> 1 #> $ cohort_start_date          <date> 2020-01-01 #> $ cohort_end_date            <date> 2020-02-15 #> $ days_exposed_acetaminophen <int> 46"},{"path":"https://darwin-eu.github.io/DrugUtilisation/articles/create_cohorts.html","id":"apply-inclusion-criteria-to-drug-cohorts","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Apply inclusion criteria to drug cohorts","title":"Creating drug cohorts","text":"created base cohort using conceptSet gapEra can apply different restrictions: require prior unexposed time: requirePriorDrugWashout() require first entry: requireIsFirstDrugEntry() require prior observation cdm: requireObservationBeforeDrug() require date within certain interval: requireDrugInDateRange()","code":""},{"path":"https://darwin-eu.github.io/DrugUtilisation/articles/create_cohorts.html","id":"requirepriordrugwashout","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Apply inclusion criteria to drug cohorts","what":"requirePriorDrugWashout()","title":"Creating drug cohorts","text":"require cohort entries (drug episodes) incident usually define time (days) individual exposed drug. can achieved using requirePriorDrugWashout() function. example restrict individuals 365 days exposure: result cohort individuals fulfill criteria: also get recorded attrition, counts settings. settings new column specified parameter used: counts updated: attrition new line: name argument can used put result different table cdm (default function updates current cohort table).
